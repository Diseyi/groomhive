        We started Groomhive as a Technology Development and Leadership training
        institution that equips young people in the Niger Delta Region with high
        demand tech skills, combined with practical exposure through real-life
        projects and Job placements. 
        <br />
        <br />
        Our training program is a 6-month intensive
        course that serves as a Launch pad for a successful career in
        Technology. At the end of the program, our trainees will become
        competitive, industry-ready entry-level to mid-level software engineers
        and product designers. 
        <br />
        <br />
        Groomhive’s model is built on Income Share
        Agreements (ISAs) – our students pay no tuition upfront, and agree to
        pay back 15% of their income post-graduation for two years.
